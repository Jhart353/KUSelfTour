1. Requirements Specification 
1.1 System Level Requirements (author name)
The goal of this project is to create an android mobile application in which the user will be able to use their handheld device to locate buildings residing on the Kutztown University of Pennsylvania campus and obtain information about such buildings and the campus itself with a download of the application and a simple tap of the finger.
The application idea was derived from the admissions staff here at Kutztown University.  The implementation of this application will help free up hours in the admissions department so that student workers can spend more time answering specific questions and tending to more advanced matters rather than walking around campus day after day touring prospective students and their parents.  Money will be saved in the account that the tour guides will not have to work as many hours; some may even be able to work from home.  The prospects will be able to tour Kutztown’s campus themselves solely with the help of their android device.  This application could be utilized even more in the summer and winter months, when tour guides’ presence are limited and buildings aren’t as easily accessible.  It can also be doubled as a digital map so new students know their location on campus at all times.
1.2 Technical Requirements (author name)
In order to develop this android application, the use of Android devices is crucial.  The software Unity and Vuforia is also being utilized for development as they are found to be the leading software (?) in the development of augmented reality.  Unity works along with Android Studio to incorporate the augmented reality features in the adroid app being developed around it.  GitHub, an “online web-based repository hosting service” has been set up to keep up to date info pertaining to the development of the KUAR (Kutztown University Augmented Reality) mobile application between the developers and the designers.
