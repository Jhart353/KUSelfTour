# CSC354-CDE335
- This repository exists as a form of version control and information sharing between the students of CDE335 and CSC354 for the Inter-disciplinary project.
- Our project is an android application with the function of allowing for a self-guided tour of the Kutztown N|S campus. Initial features include representation of information through augmented reality via an android device's camera, and some sort of location-based map system to allow for a tour through campus using only an android device.
